 Black to Gold 2nd Edition

By the time we first got out of the box, a lot of our friends were still very angry about this first edition. At first they couldn't get over how much it wasn't perfect, but soon realized that it was so darn good that even if I didn't like it at the very least, I wanted it to be loved and enjoyed more. But I still had to decide whether I wanted to make it better or not. In retrospect, I just had to let that decision slide.

It was an honor to play through this book for five years. I have to admit that I thought the story ended with a really funny ending and I'm a huge fan of Tom Gurney's "The Boy and The Woman," so it felt a bit rushed. So yeah, I guess I got more inspired by the story than anything else. But the last couple years have certainly been more enjoyable for me.

What's a good time to share your experiences with fans of Dark Fantasy?

Yes, and I love Dark Fantasy. I am really into this kind of thing, so I hope it doesn't be too long before I turn it into what I was looking for, but I'm sure it'll be a while before I can actually enjoy the book as much as I was.

Any other spoilers!

Yes, of particular interest to those of you who are unfamiliar with Dark Fantasy.

You're right, and I love it.

That's exactly what I said at the time.

No spoilers. I am so happy to see it finished and out of print. I'm sorry I don't know enough to ask, but I just wanted to tell a little bit about Dark Fantasy.

I hope you all enjoy it.

Dark Fantasy is my fantasy for a while, and I have not been able to keep up with it. It was kind of a tough year, and I could only try to get it out a year or two. The story was a lot tougher to write than I'd hoped for, because I love the characters and they didn't fit in the book. Also, the book just didn't keep growing. So when I finally said, "Okay, I want to make a new Dark Fantasy book," my life just fell apart. I mean, I could have waited and tried to create a new, great book until I found something better. But instead I just went there and it never started from a happy ending. That was a difficult year, even though I had already written a new book. I didn't want to write it, so I just wanted my new book to be so different from everything I'd been working on in Dark Fantasy.

So we're off to the last page of the book to talk about what it means…

The world is completely different this time! I can't wait to tell you! I've been wanting to talk about Dark Fantasy for so long and I'm thrilled that you all have agreed to participate.

Ohhh, yeah, so that's why I've said that. We're done talking about it, so let's start right there.

This is going to be an epic journey. I think everyone who follows the story should watch it for a while! There's a bit I missed on that page – the title of it – but I'm so glad I didn't.

For the record, I am happy to add Dark Fantasy #2 (in which the boy and the woman play out a different world than the one before), because I'm super excited about having the book out. It's pretty much where my childhood dream would have taken me if it had never been in print. There's a lot more magic in that. There's more dark, fantasy and horror! I'm thrilled to have it out for a while!

Oh my gosh, Dark Fantasy is finally out. And we're happy to let you know that Dark Fantasy #2 is out!

This is so important to me, but we really need to get this first volume out. It is such an important piece of history, to make it even better than it already was. I feel like Dark Fantasy #2 is a huge step in my journey, and I can't wait to read it. So I really want to do this in as many books as I can. You have never read an entire book before.

It's a big deal to be on the cusp of what will be the year's book in my life.

It's been my life for so long, and this is the time period where you feel really secure in your own world. It's a real honor. I'm excited to be part of something so special because I know I should. This book has been kind of crazy, but it's really nice. I'm so pleased to have got a chance to do it. I love this book for so many reasons! It's so much better
