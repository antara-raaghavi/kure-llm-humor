======== SAMPLE 1 ========
ieves, Leif Weintraub, and the Jungle Book. For a while it looked like The Fantastic and the Womanizer. I think we've seen this many on this blog, for good/bad purposes. But I've often wondered: Is this why we've been seeing Shakespeare in Modern Love? But, we've gotten to know Shakespeare with Shakespeare... and we've come to know Shakespeare as we've progressed.
I've never seen Shakespeare play in English! Forget Shakespeare, I'll tell you about my favorite scene from Romeo and Juliet. I'll also share some of the most wonderful interactions Shakespeare had with Shakespeare and Shakespeareano. I'll also cover a lot of Shakespeare's own stuff! I'll also talk a little bit about how Shakespeare's fiction and poetry impacted him on an immense deal, from Gillian on the Wings of the Dove to Shakespeare on Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare's Sonnets and Temptress Moon... and I'll also tell you about the role-playing game we played on Scrabble!
I'll make an Englishman's point.
