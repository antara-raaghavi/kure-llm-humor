======== SAMPLE 1 ========

. . . And here, the good news has gotten a whole lot better. For instance, you can use a number in the first line of your script to set an example. You can say, "Well, I'll go to the bank and I'll find a woman with a gun and we'll get her to pay a $30 fine." And then when you write your next sentence that sentence, you're already talking about the fact that in an ideal world, we'd have that guy in the driver's seat, and the girl who bought that ticket is also paying a $25 fine.

Boomerous Magic. But, if you look at the movie and think about how much stuff you're saying about that guy â€” there's no way to prove anything, if we didn't ask him to pay, because he wouldn't. You've got to find an audience. So we go around, and by now we're on top of people, on top of each other. So, by now we're at the apex of our game, we're in the bottom half of it, we're in the top half of it, we're in no position to back down.

So, by now we're in the middle of the pack. But, by now, we're in a different position, and we're not a match for them.

It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, by contrast, is an interesting movie in that you can't really get the message across to people. So, by now we're in a different position, and the audience and the director are just going to have to sort of figure out how to sell you on the notion that if you're going to come out on top, then you should be giving them your support. So, by now we're in a different position, and the camera's a little tired. But, by now, it's looking better.

If You're a Thief And You Get an Honor, by contrast, is a movie that's really getting the point across. There's no way to tell if you're a really bad guy, because the most powerful thing to do is to play around and see who you think is smarter. So, by now we're in a different position, and we're in a different position.
