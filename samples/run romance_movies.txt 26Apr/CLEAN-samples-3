Butcher, the new Marvel Cinematic Universe in which he was a villain. With Marvel now known for its cinematic cinematic universe in which most films in a cinematic universe featured a female lead, The Amazing Spider-Man's Tony Stark and Luke Cage have earned some of the most glowing reviews of the year. It should come as no surprise to any fan of Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Thor, however, as much is expected of the big-name actor, who starred with Thor only on TV in 2006. Thor's debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been nothing short of epic in terms of character development, and the film certainly delivers.

But what if his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has not been as epic as many had thought? And how would you describe how Marvel's cinematic universe would have been if not for Thor's involvement in Captain America vs. Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and The Avengers? What if the Marvel Cinematic Universe had not even opened up to the many other big Marvel stars and movies that were being developed at Marvel by the studio? It would be the most unlikely of the times to have a superhero movie or film at an end, but it could just have been a surprise when Spider-Man debuted to wide acclaim in 2011. And that's not counting the first of his solo films. Thor will not appear in any other Marvel movies, but he will probably be one of Marvel's biggest hit performers, with the studio taking no chances with any of his latest projects. As much as it's a nice change of pace, it's also been a long time coming.
But we'll keep waiting.<|endoftext|>From Terraria Wiki
