Top, you got a nice little bonus.
"Well, you were a bit under a bit of pressure after your big win (in the A-League) and you needed a little breather," he said, laughing. "I think I did a little bit more than that. I think I'll play a couple more games in the coming weeks to make sure you're feeling good."
"I don't feel very good and I think I'll just go back to where I was and I'll just play a little more."

"I want to get out in the air and just let go of everything I've been doing. But you know, I really wanted to enjoy this season and then I wanted to see where I was heading. Maybe next year I can get a little more out in front. I think I've gotten to where I am now."
"I was really glad to come here. I feel really good to be here."
"That's what I thought about right? I was just so happy to come here."
As for the rest of the year it seemed to just be a quiet one, and I just felt like there was a lot to do. After seeing a lot of great games I was still thinking, I want to go out and play as much as I possibly can. So I decided to continue to play, and I found a few things I liked. I did get in trouble, but that was probably the biggest thing that's gone on. I think with all of those things I've improved."
"I think with all these players I've really helped the team. My game has become a lot cleaner and I think I'm just a player who knows how to hit. You can learn a lot from a good player."
"I like to run to the ball. You can't do anything else."
"I think in the world of New York I like doing that with people. If they're going to take a step back and look at me and say my hands are down you've got to start playing harder and take a little look at me."
And of course, there have been many more surprises in the past couple of years.
"I got in a car accident in the summer and he got out and ran me. I've got to get some other stuff ready. It's been an amazing summer and I'm definitely not done. I've still got to have one of my best games in New York to win it."

For one thing, in addition to the original idea, another idea to add an episode to the original screenplay, and a number of other interesting things on which the original movie was based, Universal and Warner Bros. brought in several new characters in the form of a new character named Zodiac.

Zodiac is an unnamed man who lives in a cave in Antarctica, and his name is mentioned in the film, which is called "The Cave of Dreams."
Here's a look at Zodiac on a poster in the original movie.
This concept, known as "Vampires in the Old Country," was first seen at a preview in 1988, and was featured in the movie. It was then moved from "Old Country," which had an alternate story to "Celestial Paradise," to "The Cave of Dreams," which had Zodiac in an old piano playing with a live orchestra. "Celestial Paradise" would have included an orchestra.
The movie also revealed that Zodiac would be a male character in the filmâ€”this fact is confirmed by the casting director, Scott M. Powers, who asked to give Zodiac another name: "The Beast in a Suit," rather than "The Beast in a Suit." M.M. Powers later commented that Zodiac would be a very well-known and recognizable character, though at this writing he doesn't appear to be on the receiving end of many of his references.
Even though the movie is called "Zodiac in a Suit," Zodiac in a Suit would have been more than likely a reference to the movie. In 1989, at the end of the first movie, Zodiac would have been depicted as a man in a suit in the movie.
The film also introduced the possibility of Zodiac, as an English gentleman, in the movie. However, the English-language version of Zodiac, featuring an English chauffeur, is an English chauffeur. There are two English chauffeurs in "Celestial Paradise," although neither of them ever appeared in the film.
There were two other characters who were featured in "A Place Called Paradise." It was a scene from "A Place Called Paradise."
