T I N T I N T E J S A L T E D T T E<|endoftext|>Trouble is, though, that they won't know how much money they have until the next game in March. A new ad for Nintendo, with over $1 billion in preorders, is in the works, but it's still a long way from Nintendo's goal, anyway.

Somehow, the video isn't even quite as interesting as we'd like: It's a shot of Nintendo and Mario and Luigi in the room:
The rest of the ad is just funny.
There is the briefcase video, as in it's name, and an audio-back to the clip from the original "Dance with Me" song, which the audience loves. It also has a cameo in Mario Gaiden:
And on top of the game itself, there's this one shot.
If you're keeping score, you have to wonder who did the original idea for this. The video was first suggested on YouTube and went live on 4chan, eventually turning into a viral viral video because the person behind it couldn't do much and was banned from YouTube. So then they gave you this.
So to that video, the original idea is that if they want kids to enjoy themselves, and they don't want too many kids going to college, a Nintendo game would be better than a Nintendo game. And we know this, because there's even a GameCube game in the video:
A more recent video, which has also been on YouTube, appears to be based on the Super Nintendo Story. It's in an alliterative English version of "Shoot a Nintendo!", so it's probably just as good as this original video, though the sound is also different: "Shooting a Nintendo game!"
In fact, the video is so pretty and clever that it almost seems like "Shooting a Mario game!" is a little too silly.
You can watch the Nintendo version of the video, and you can pick up a copy on iTunes here and here, or you can also get a PDF of the video here for just $7.99. The demo itself is still live here:<|endoftext|>From Halopedia, the Halo wiki
The Ogrilok, a ship built by Colonel Yves in an early stage of the First War. During the first battle over Ogrilok and destroyed and wounded the Tzahn.[1] Shortly thereafter, the Ogrilok was discovered to be inhabited.
The Ogrilok's appearance as a weapon in Destiny can only be imagined in the light of the Ogrilok's destruction and its impact on the Covenant at Halo: Combat Evolved.[2]
History [ edit ]
First encounter [ edit ]
When Captain M.W. Anderson learned of the Ogrilok's destruction in October 2000, he and his team of soldiers took advantage of Colonel Yves' discovery. M.W. Anderson was in the area and needed to go to scout-out. He decided to go down in search of one who was missing. Suddenly, M.W. Anderson discovered Ogrilok and found the Covenant.
M.W. Anderson and a small crew of his friends were on standby when Ogrilok was discovered by the Forerunner forces. Ogrilok revealed to all the crew of the Forerunner Army that Yves had planted a genetic mirror in the Ogrilok's head, and the team was on the ground. M.W. Anderson and his men captured Ogrilok, killed them, and took him in.
The crew then returned to the shore and set off to find Ogrilok. By this point-of-the-game, the entire team had been destroyed at close range. M.W. Anderson was able to escape the battle and, after taking out the Covenant, was able to rescue Yves.
In the aftermath of the battle, he is reunited with his comrades. He and his team of friends and, in return, their loved ones are spared, thanks to his help. He returns to the ship and, at this time, is in the field with the remaining Forerunners and a small team of Spartans. In order to be with the other Spartans, he gives permission to return to Ogrilok.[3]
Return [ edit ]
The Spartans return to Ogrilok in order to save their lives, but with Ogrilok's assistance.
After Ogrilok returned to him, they find him with the rest of the team. When the battle is over, he is still in the ship, and the rest of the team is also present on the beach.
The team gets close to Ogrilok when M.W. Anderson brings them to his place where he would have to help him get through the final battle.
