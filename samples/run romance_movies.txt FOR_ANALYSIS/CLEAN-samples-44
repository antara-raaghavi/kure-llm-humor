"A Farewell to Arms" by Harry Potter.
That's an easy one if you've never heard it. But we were wrong.
When I say I don't care if Harry says or doesn't say anything, Harry does it because of the way he looks.
When Harry does it, it means because Harry likes what he sees.
When I say I'll always have an affection for you, I'll always have an affection for you.
When I say I'll protect you, I'll protect you from anyone.
When I say I'll protect you from anyone from within, I'll protect from anyone.
When I say I'll protect you from anyone from below, I'll protect from anyone below.
When I say I'll protect you from anyone below from above, I'll protect from anyone below from below.
When I say I'll protect you from anyone from below, I'll protect from anyone below from below.
When I say I'll protect you from anyone from below, I'll protect from anyone from below from below.
