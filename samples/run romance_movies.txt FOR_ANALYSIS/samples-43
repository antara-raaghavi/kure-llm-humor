To see if I had any ideas for this chapter, just click here.<|endoftext|>For the past several years, we've been discussing how we've got to bring an American perspective to the world of cricket. Many of those discussions were aimed squarely at North American players, and a great deal of an American-centric discussion focused on Australia. But the one we've decided to keep, and make a habit of giving to the American community, is the one in which we've been able to make the point that we've had to change perceptions and expectations.
No one in the business of cricket's top Indian players has ever been to the top of the Indian board, and if we're to really stand a chance of beating English cricketers, Englishmen, we've got a ton of work to do to achieve it. But we can't ignore the fact that our national team is the envy of the world.
The only thing we've never had the decency to ask of them on the field in an Ashes-coincidence is to ask if we've ever met an American. But we've all had the decency that comes with that. Much of the success of our national teams comes at the expense of the other team. But we've all had the decency that comes with having the decency to let the American team out of the bag on the final day.
To this day, some of the greatest sporting minds in the world have been friends or colleagues in the American game. But we've all had the decency to let our local team out of the bag on the final day.
No doubt we've all made a living in the game of cricket. But if we've all been lucky enough to play an incredibly large part in what has undoubtedly been a brilliant and ultimately successful international career, we've all had the decency to let our local team out of the bag on the final day.
That being said, we've all had the decency to let our local players out of the bag on the final day, and we've all, too, had the decency to let our local players take the ball in their own hands in the process.
To be fair, it's always been the case that the more we've had to learn from past encounters, the less we'll ever have to learn to accept that we've all had a heart of gold. But to have to learn to accept for the first time, we've all got to learn to respect our opponents.
Among the many good memories we've had to go by, and to feel indebted to have come across, was the time when we took an American to lunch at a restaurant and his response in an American accent was to say, "That was the best I've had!"
Some of the most memorable days of our cricketing career came when we all went to the All Blacks' headquarters and they asked an American if he could play for All Black.
