======== SAMPLE 1 ========

When we go to Vegas, we can hear the Blues and Dukes on the radio, we can't stop thinking about their music and their music and the way they play it. You've got to get this up. You've got to go all the way.
And all because I know I'm on my first visit.
If I say this and I go to Las Vegas, I've got to talk to the Blues, Dukes, and The Beatles. There's no such thing as too many things. Just keep on.
If you're going to Vegas, don't be afraid to make the most of your home in Vegas. Get on a plane.
If you're going to Las Vegas, don't be afraid to spend three days with The Beatles.
Just keep on.
And if you're going to Vegas, be prepared to miss the show.
