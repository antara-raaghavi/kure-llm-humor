The second of seven seasons of Game Of Thrones is the longest-running, and it's an amazing feat to watch. For those of you who haven't seen it, this is the first episode in Season Seven of The Game Of Thrones. After this episode, Sansa was back on her feet and preparing to begin a new adventure. The scene was so spectacular, and the ending in which she was rescued from the King's Landing jail was so poignant, and when we went to see the opening and the beginning of the sequence, we were so enthralled by the scene that we went up to the window and just felt how beautiful that is.
While we love our heroes, we love seeing them in action, and we love seeing them in action. All of it means: we're in for a treat with The Last Rose On The Right Side of the Stone.

And if you'll excuse me for a moment, I think we've all seen the picture of Jon Snow as he was on his fourth and final season. You can't help the feeling that he's back in the game.
In the third episode of Game Of Thrones, Snow and Jeannie have an awkward conversation and Jon and Jeannie, after seeing each other in person, find out Jon's a bit drunk. Much to our delight as we turned the tables on one of these situations, Jeannie told her fiancé, "Hey, you've probably slept in a different room that night. It looks like you've slept with a guy a bit drunk. But I'll call you back, because it might mean something to you." J.R.R. Tolkien has always been a fan of the classic fantasy book, having written The Prince of Peace and King Arthur's Last Courage. The scene with Snow in her bathtub at the end of The Lion King was truly a great moment.
