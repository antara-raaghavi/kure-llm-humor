I just have too many of these words and then the thought of it gets to me.
So there is no substitute for a complete understanding of the meaning of the words.
The final phrase is "You don't make it" and the meaning of the words is my guide to understanding them:
What has happened to me since the days I was a baby? This is where I first experienced what life has to offer and what it takes for me to succeed.

I was a little girl.
I was a child of the future in the middle of nowhere
I was a little boy
