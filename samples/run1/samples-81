======== SAMPLE 1 ========


RICHARD:
Come to our king, to know the king's love.

KING RICHARD IV:
I say he is.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let him speak.

VOLUMNIO:
But I know not what.

VOLUMNIO:
Why, I pray, he hath known.

VOLUMNIO:
A fearful thought!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I cannot but pray.

VOLUMNIO:
Thou hast known that there hath been a man of death,
But of joy: and now it be no more;
Where canst thou know he is dead?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do not know.

VOLUMNIO:
O my dear queen,
Wherefore thou art my son,
And I call upon thee.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But the way is clear; and God forbid
That thou art so poor.

VOLUMNIO:
Away with this king;
I am yet a prisoner in prison;
To get thee a pardon for this crime,
You must not live.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Is there no other king: thou shouldst,
You may never live without such me.

VOLUMNIO:
O king of all,
To-night, to-night,
To-night, O god! let this do
I'll.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I see that thou hast a crown.

VOLUMNIO:
O my god! let this go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more! no more!
The king of such a thought!
You are all villains!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more.

VOLUMNIO:
Thou shalt.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That I think thou shalt be so, I swear
By this oath, that no harm that I speak
Thou mayst think I am wrong.

VOLUMNIO:
Nay, no harm.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thou must.

VOLUMNIO:
Nay, if thou must, I will make thee mader
In all the land: if thou wilt make thee mader,
Thou must make thee mader.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more.

VOLUMNIO:
You must not live, I am too late.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I will have thee hanged.

VOLUMNIO:
No more.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I will, my dear queen, that thy death should do
My brother so much good.

VOLUMNIO:
O, what so?
To kill so many in so many lives,
Is impossible.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For his part, for my part,
My true cause.

VOLUMNIO:
O, I do, and I will kill thee.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No more, my lord; for thy love is gone.

VOLUMNIO:
Away thou, my queen, if it be but two nights
Thou sleepest withal, but thee withal;
The hour shall not be long, nor the hour
Will not be long, nor not midnight, nor night;
Whose heart doth but crave, and whiles it seek
It is with a dead body; who seeks it that wants
More life: thou art not dead:
Thy heart is dead; and thou art not dead.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Thy heart was dead; and thou art dead.

VOLUMNIO:
O my lord, how the world shall be changed!

DUKE BOWING:
My heart! what is so in this!

VOLUMNIO:
My mind! what is the matter?

DUKE BOWING:
I would thou be like that, my lord, thou couldst tell.

VOLUMNIO:
O, thou wilt die, my lord, I do.

DUKE BOWING:
O, what thoughts wouldst thou have had?

VOLUMNIO:
O, I do not know where to draw thyself.

DUKE BOWING:
But that I shall find thee.

VOLUMNIO:

The heavens be changed. Is that I am?
