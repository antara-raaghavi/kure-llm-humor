======== SAMPLE 1 ========

The new leader, J.B., is being forced to take his place in parliament by the general election of the people. A great deal may come to his advantage and may be seen in this election.

FOURTH RICHMOND

First:
Our general election is in London. We have the opportunity of a general election within the day, after which to-morrow we shall send an army. I am told it is not so.

CLIFFORD HENRY

Then,
The general election is held not in the morning. A general election is held in the late day.

BENKELEY:
Your officers are in the company of the general officers to take their seat,
with which we shall make a general election tomorrow.

BENKELEY:
I must not say so, but I cannot.

WARWICK:
If all is well, let him be sworn in.

WARWICK:
I trust his general election:
I am in his company.

BENKELEY:
And he will swear the people of the people:
He may as well be sworn:
His election is in the first-day, and in the next day.

WARWICK:
He must be:
As the state of matters is to all officers,
they have got their officers for an election,
but so cannot be made.

COMIN:
Go, my friends! Take your oaths.

CAPTAIN KING OF YORK:
Where were the officers the king with the people?

KING HENRY:
Some of them were brought before.

CAPTAIN KING OF YORK:
There are two officers in the room;
They have been sworn in as follows:

COMIN:
The general assembly with the people is ready
for a general election.

WARWICK:
Go, be it done; and be done.

JULIET:
If the people require one election, they shall not yet
the people.

CORNISHEWA:
I have done so.

WARWICK:
I have not, nor cannot.

TIGER:
Where's the general, the prince of England?

WARWICK:
I am in the company to take the seat.

CORNISHEWA:
That's fair of him!

WARWICK:
He can be sworn in for the day:
And he shall not, unless there be a warrant;
there must be.

KING HENRY:
Where's the general, and to-morrow and the coming of the soldiers?

CLIFFORD HENRY:
If he be not sworn and I cannot, I cannot tell.

WARWICK:
My honour, my lords, this is the coming of the people.

COMIN:
What shall be?

CAPTAIN KING OF YORK:
I have a warrant from God and shall give it.

WARWICK:
Go, then, and do it.

COMIN:
The word will be heard; and not, I fear,
the thing will be.
Now, shall you be sworn in?

SISKO:
There shall be no oath, but by the royal oath.

KING HENRY:
God bless you, brother!

COMIN:
We must at least have them sworn in.

CAPICORNIO:
No, my lord, no;
The oaths with which you were sworn to swear are not.

KING HENRY:

The men and women sworn should not be sworn;
there were a dozen sworn.

COMIN:
The oaths, with which you were sworn, shall not be,
but be sworn.
God bless:
This is a state of matter that is unknown.

COMIN:
The rest shall be sworn for the coming of them.

BENKEN:


WARWICK:
No, he shall be sworn for the making of him for.

KING HENRY:
No, I have done so.
I do swear it.

CLIFFORD HENRY:
Now, I do swear that I shall have a general election:
And we shall make a general election for the people and
the king: I shall make this election for him in the day.

JULIET:
Go, be it done; and be done.

CAPICORNIO:
Go, be it done; and be done.

CHUCKEN:
We'll know, our honourable lords:
The people are sworn, and we shall see it;
there shall be no word not spoken of it.
