New Haven, Connecticut.
It's the Lush Forest Resort from the original Blue Lagoon on the Green Berm
This is a place where you can relax, enjoy nature, and drink a good Red Wine at the local wine shop.
In a world where "fancy" wines are the norm in your life, let's hope it is not too much like the World Heritage Place.
At the end of the day the Lush Forest Resort is a place of pride; it's a good way to relax or be surrounded by loved ones. We use the space wisely. There is something for everyone.
This experience and atmosphere will appeal to every person that goes there.
What a lovely place.
But Lush Forest
The Lush Forest Resort is a special place because of this unique, romantic ambience.
Over the course of a night, you'll get some really memorable vibes and drinks in a Lush Forest.
This place is the home of the Lush Forest for New Haven
Wherever you see it on a rainy autumn day, we'll be in your dreams!
We always want something the Lush Forest doesn't haveâ€¦
We only buy the Lush Forest Reserve in a few months
