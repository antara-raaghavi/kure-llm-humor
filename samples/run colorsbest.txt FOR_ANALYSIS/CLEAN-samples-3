======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Abyss was one of the last remaining strongholds in the Imperium and thus only the finest mercenaries, such as the Vexing and Theo, could have made the leap across the stars. After a war for four years, the Emperor finally recognized his weakness, and the world turned into a massive, chaotic mess.

When Horus arrived on Mars, Mars itself had been the perfect place to conquer the galaxy. The Empire had been conquered in every way imaginable by Mars and they also had the ability to conquer its vast expanse of territory including the far reaches of the Red Sea at sea. But the planet was at its greatest peril as the Emperor had decided that he would need to start over and not look for new territories from elsewhere in the galaxy... he found the planet too vast for the planet to grow. The Emperor had chosen to use his vast space resources to create a new world, a world which would rival anything in the galaxy that existed in its previous incarnation, and a planet that could defend all of Earth from the most advanced invaders. The Emperor also chose to move forward with the creation of his new Star Empire, known as the Star Empire, which would form a federation of interstellar power, a system of the greatest powers in the galaxy. This was the last and greatest chance to break the Empire of the Vexing and the rest of the Imperium, though it did not go through as planned.
The Emperor, knowing that this would lead to the destruction of his greatest enemy - the Earth-based Vexing - took matters into his own hands by making a deal with the Vexing's former leader, the Earth-based Vexing, to begin a massive campaign to overthrow the Vexing's ruler. When Horus and his followers fell against his command, the Vexing used a new technology known as Solar Beam, allowing them to bombard the planet with their own Solar Flux, and at the same time they launched a fleet of a dozen vessels capable of crushing the Empire of the Vexing. However, before this could happen the Emperor's ship was destroyed, and the new planet was destroyed entirely and completely within hours. The Vexing and their new ruler used the Star Empire against all the Imperial forces on Earth, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of its own members and stealing the Star Empire.
The Emperor's plan had not worked out, but he was determined to ensure that the Empire had no less enemies and had sent a new fleet of Star Battleships to destroy all of its military equipment and to destroy all of the other war fleets in the Milky Way Galaxy. The Emperor also chose to launch a fleet of several dozen warships which included three-pronged assaults on Earth, one attack on a small planet known as the Bionis system, the second attack on Earth on a large planet known as the Sun Nebula, and the third attack on Earth on Earth on the same planet the planet was attacked by a second attack. The Emperor's fleet was destroyed when he lost control of the ships, and the other five ships of the fleet went missing and eventually they were both destroyed.
The Emperor was very determined to continue with his plan until his final days with the Vexing and the Earth-based Vexing, and he had no choice but to destroy whatever ship he could. The Emperor had to find some of the Vexing's most powerful minds and find out what was in the minds of the young Vexing to be destroyed. The Emperor went through a system where he saw that the Vexing were all in on the act, and the Vexing were a huge threat to him, because they were the best in the galaxy at what they could do and if they could not do anything... they would turn against him. He had to bring the worlds with him to his final destination and he had to find the planets. As if they could not stand and die for this cause... one of the planets of the galaxy exploded and the Emperor went through a huge depression of chaos and he had to rescue his planet from the Vexing.
The Emperor and his fleet was destroyed on Earth and the planet was devastated by the first Vexing attack on it. He would have to do what his best friend, Darth Sidious, did and save the people of Earth before the last Vexing attack.
What can we learn from the events in the third episode of the series, "The Long Game"?"
While the last episode introduced the various characters who will appear in the novel, this novel will take us directly to the next chapter... the first time the Emperor is in the same room with the second, and the last time he was in his room with the third. The characters he will interact with will also be the same as the original. His powers have evolved throughout the series, and they will now be more powerful, more cunning, and more dangerous and will be even more devastating to his people.<|endoftext|>What do these two cards represent?
