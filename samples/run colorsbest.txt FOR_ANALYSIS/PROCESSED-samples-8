(Warning: This post contains spoilers for Super Friday, and contains spoilers for the next Super Friday. If you're not in the mood to read it, please let me know in the comments! It could be scary.)
For those of us who don't know, Super Friday is a regular occurrence at our favorite restaurants. Every Wednesday at 4:00pm we celebrate on the menu with a handful of fried eggs. The eggs are seasoned in a special and tasty sauce on top of them and the sauce is made from the fermented soy beans of the palm oil family. It's my absolute favorite combination of fried eggs, so if you're in love with Super Friday (or at least you are) my recommendation is for you to make it with my homemade Sesame Seed Butter and White Chocolate.
These Eggs are one of those things you know you can make in a hurry when you are on holiday just ask my mom.
For a snack (or a small snack!) they are a great source of protein, a great source of potassium, and a great source of potassium chloride. But of course, I don't recommend eating more than two cups per day. We don't need to buy extra food when it is cold out because it'll bring on fat. We don't usually want that extra food, but I like to put it that way just to try to keep the eggs in the right balance.
In the interest of simplicity, here are eight dishes that I have tried. (Or just take a peek at my Super Bowl favorites)
