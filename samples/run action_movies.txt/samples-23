======== SAMPLE 1 ========
ock is the name of the game. It's part survival horror and part action/adventure game, and as such needs to have some of the same feel and feel of a first-person shooter.

For a long time the premise for Ghost in the Shell was the same as that of the horror novel Stranger Good, with a very violent conclusion as the villain, and the villain's main motivation for the action was his desire to kill, not to save anyone. It seems like Ghost in the Shell took a little longer because of this, but I was pretty happy with it. It also helped that its protagonist, Desmond, is from New York, and he is very well-liked by the locals.

The Story

The events lead up to Desmond's initial encounter with the Killer. It's a fairly straightforward scenario, and at the beginning you are in the care of the police; you know they're on a big hunt for a murderer who wants to take credit for the death of his own people. There isn't much you can say about it other than wait and see.

In the course of our initial conversation it's clear that the killer, in the middle of our story, is in a car accident, going into the night, and he's hitting someone in the head or head and maybe a car. He shoots, and this person is dead in the street. The killer does not shoot. It is a pretty brutal sequence.

But this isn't a simple scenario. As you know the Killer never does anything violent. He doesn't stop. It doesn't even matter. There are no bullets to shoot.
