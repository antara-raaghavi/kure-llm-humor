======== SAMPLE 1 ========

I started reading on the subway a couple of years ago, and I noticed that the most popular fare-paying service has very little in common with real subway travel. The trains are actually very boring: the trains are actually quite fast and the stations are filled with people rushing around looking for one another. It's an uncomfortable way to spend your time, but it's also great fun.

But you shouldn't live in Paris unless you're in the middle of a movie: A French Connection movie, in which three French police officers (played by French people) try to kidnap a French politician.

In the movie, the only way you're going to get away with it is if you kill the French first. The French don't even let the French off the hook, and the mayor of Paris is furious and demands your money.

But the movie has an element of suspense: the French actually let the politician off the hook, so the movie actually begins. The police have to come up with a plan, and instead of being able to do anything about it, the plan is to kill the French.

But the plan doesn't work: you only hurt himself.

The French actually get more brutal: after the mayor of Paris, Alain Juppe, goes to war with the French, the French government turns a blind eye and starts funding the entire French army to take over from the French in the second French World War.

The French government decides to pay them back, and Juppe, who has been stationed in New York City since the war began, heads to Detroit to try to rally the French to the defense of their nation. It all culminates in a French hostage situation and the death of another American citizen in a Dallas church, where the government takes him hostage.

But you can't live without your favorite French TV series, right?
